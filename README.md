#Queue Manager in Stadium

##About our Project:

Important Note : We have Submitted 2 Version of Our Program.Both of them have same motive to get the people at the gates of the stadium get Entry in minimum time but both are implemented differently.The main code in both the codes is version 1.

##About the Version 1:
    About Functionality of the code: 
   
    We implemented this code with the help of Array Data Structure.
    
    First of all Program ask the user to enter the number of gates the stadium consists.Than using random function is used to allocate time to each gate.
    Then there program asks the user to enter the number of people in the Stadium.Then there is Random allocation of half people is done by the user by entering the people at each gate.After the Random Allocation 
    the rest half people will be assigned to random gate in the form group contains random people and the gates are also opened for the peoples in the stadium when the rest people started entering the gates.The       time is updated after the each increment and decrement in the code.And after each increment and decrement there is switching of the people form one gate to another gate occuring.The peoples from gate consists     of maximum people are assigned to the gate with the minimum time.
    
    And we added few more features to this code which will give better experience to the user.

    
##About the Version 2:
    About Functionality of the code:
    
    We implemented this code with the help of Array Data Structure.
    The first part is same in both the versions.But the difference in this version is that we are not using the random function in this function we directly ask the user the time taken by the gate of the stadium.
    There also ome option givent o user if they need to enter the same time taken to get entry in the gate.Then the peoples are assigned randomly in the gates.Then Group of random people are assigned to random        gate,after each random assignment the people present at gate with maximum time are suggested to switch to the gate with minmum time.If they want to switch then people at the gates are asked how many of them       would like to switch.If the people are more than the suggested peoples then there is no switching occurs and if the people in the group willing to swittch is less than the suggested people then they are           switched.This occurs at each random assignment of the people.Also there is condition of they do not want to switch.In this case the program continues and peoples are assigning after the suggestion.This        
    program will run till the time at each gates is not nearly same or having very small difference.
